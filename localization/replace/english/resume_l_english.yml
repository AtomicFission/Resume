 # Hobby Descriptions
 paradox_video_games:0 "@bullet_point_black! Paradox Video Games"
 paradox_video_games_tt:0 "I have played #T Paradox Grand Strategy#! games since the age of 11 in grade 6. I have always enjoyed PDX games (including #Y Ck3#!, #Y EU4#!, #Y VIC2#!, #Y HOI4#!, etc) all the way to this day. Along with other influences, these games helped me find my passion for history, politics, military strategy, etc."
 strategy_video_games:0 "@bullet_point_black! Strategy Video Games"
 strategy_video_games_tt:0 "I have played #Y Strategy Games#! since the age of 10 in #T Grade 5#!. Literally ANYTHING that has to do with strategy and thinking immediately catches my attention, hence why an entire company that is most famous for Grand Strategy Games like #T Paradox Interactive#! is my uncontested favourite."
 coding_hobby:0 "@bullet_point_black! Coding"
 coding_hobby_tt:0 "Discovering this skill unintentionally after the Covid-19 era began, coding became one of my favourite hobbies to do in my free time.\nMy passion for coding had led me to learn a lot in a limited time frame including #Y Python#!, basics of #Y C++#!, how to use #Y Unity Engine#!, #Y Unity Engine UI#!, #Y PDX Script#!, and #Y PDX GUI#!"
 history_n_politics:0 "@bullet_point_black! Learning about History & Politics"
 history_n_politics_tt:0 "Since discovering strategy games and finishing my first project related to History in #T Grade 5#!, I discovered I had a passion for history and politics. I am particularly interested in #Y Islamic history#!, the #Y Medieval Era#!, the #Y Renessaince Era#!, the #Y Victorian Era#!, and the #Y Modern Era#!"
 # Skill Descriptions
 python_skill_desc:0 "#T Python #!\n\nI consider my #Y Python#! skills to be advanced as I fully grasp the basics and intermediate fundamentals of the language while learning libraries such as #Y Threading#! and #Y Asyncio#!"
 cpp_skill_desc:0 "#T C++ #!\n\nI would consider my #Y C++#! skills are on an intermediate level since I don't have as much experience with the language. However I was still able to grasp the syntax and basic fundamentals including #Y Functions#!, #Y OOP#!, #Y Variable Types#!, #Y Pointers#!, etc"
 csharp_skill_desc:0 "#T C## Unity #!\n\nLike #Y C++#!, I would consider my skills to be rather intermediate, however, since #Y C###! is a higher level of programming than C++, it is much easier to program what I have in mind"
 pdx_script_skill_desc:0 "#T PDX Script #!\n\nBy far, I would say I am most skilled with #Y PDX Script#! at an expert's level. While I still have much to learn, #Y PDX Script#! is a modding language and not an open-ended language. Hence, I can confidently say I am capable of doing #G ANYTHING#! the language allows me to"
 pdx_gui_skill_desc:0 "#T PDX GUI #!\n\nLike #Y PDX Script#!, I am skilled with #Y PDX GUI#!, however, I have yet to learn how to work with shaders for instance. Still, I know most of the language (particularly in Imperator: Rome and CK3) and can design everything #Y to do#! and #Y to look#! how I want."
 # Project Titles
 troll_project:0 "The \"Troll\" Project (1/4)"
 meme_project:0 "The \"Meme\" Project (2/4)"
 pdx_project:0 "The \"PDX\" Project (3/4)"
 unity_project:0 "The \"Unity\" Project (4/4)"
 # Project Desc
 projects_desc:0 "In this page, I show a list of exciting projects I worked on whether it may be in #Y C## Unity#! or #Y PDX Script/GUI#!"
 troll_project_desc:0 "What better way to start off by showing my \"troll\" project\nAs you can see in the screenshot below, I made a mod called 'Free DLC: Battle for the Bosporus'"
 troll_project_desc2:0 "However, little does the user know, when he runs the mod, he will... *** drum roll ***"
 troll_project_desc3:0 "...get rick rolled!\n\nDon't worry, I would never make an actual mod that recreates a DLC for free\n\nOh and as a side note incase you haven't noticed, you JUST got rick rolled as well :)"
 meme_project_desc:0 "Not only is there the \"Troll\" project, but also the \"Meme\" project\nThis mod which is known as #Y CK3 Real Time#! is by far the most popular mod I made\n\nAs the name suggests, you would have to leave Ck3 running for 24 hours straight before a day in-game passes"
 pdx_project_desc:0 "Now on to the real deal\nI would like to show my \"PDX\" game related project\nIt is a mod that integrates Civilization 5/6's Wonder system into Imperator: Rome\n\nHere are a few screenshots to depict the works of the project\n\nFirst, there is a list of wonders that are buildable based on how advanced a nation is\nThen, if all the requirements are met: correct terrain, money, etc, the country/player can build the wonder in return for permanent state benefits"
 pdx_project_desc2:0 "Once the construction begins, the days tick by and the progress bar moves up\nFurthermore, an event can pop up to speed up/slow down the construction of the wonder"
 pdx_project_desc3:0 "Finally, when the progress bar reaches 100.0%, an event pops up where the wonder is built and gives the state benefits"
 pdx_project_desc4:0 "A 3D model also appears on the province in which the wonder is built (this applies to all provinces in game, not just Lavinium)"
 pdx_project_desc5:0 "You may be wondering why I picked a project to show from 1.5 and not 2.0\n\nWell, while I did lots of GUI/Scripting in 2.0, those projects weren't my main focus as I was working on Unity and was taking a break from coding, and hence weren't the most polished"
 unity_project_desc:0 "Last but certainly not least, I would like to show that I have experience with using #Y Game Engines#!, more specifically #Y Unity#!\n\nJust like my projects using PDX language and Python, I mainly specialize in GUI/Scripting\n\nI recreated Among Us 'Tasks'\nFor instance, this download task"
 unity_project_desc2:0 "I also made things like opening and closing a sliding door just like in Among Us"
 unity_project_desc3:0 "Type in the code recreation as well (Oxygen Sabotage Fix Recreation)"
 unity_project_desc4:0 "These were just a few of what I made and the easiest to show\n\nIf you want to see more, I can show the Unity Project code"
